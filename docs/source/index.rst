Welcome to the documentation of "GlabTop2-py"
=============================================

This document describes **GlabTop2-py**, which is a Python package that calculates the ice-thickness distribution for
all glaciers in the model domain. GlabTop2-py uses Python 3.11 or a later version, and PCRaster functionalities. GlabTop2-py is entirely based on the
GlabTop2 concepts :cite:`Frey2014`, which are well-described `here <https://www.the-cryosphere.net/8/2313/2014/tc-8-2313-2014.pdf>`_.

.. note::

   Latest release: 2.1.1
   
   GlabTop2-py is now available as an :ref:`App <running_app>` that runs in the browser.
   
   GlabTop2-py works with Python versions >= 3.11.

   PCRaster will now be automatically installed if GlabTop2-py is installed using :ref:`Anaconda <installation_anaconda>`.
   Manual installation of PCRaster version 4.0.0 is still required if GlabTop2-py is installed using :ref:`pip <installation_pip>` or manually
   downloaded from my `GlabTop2-py GitHub repository <https://github.com/WilcoTerink/GlabTop2-py>`_.
